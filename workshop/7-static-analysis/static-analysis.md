## Static analysis

**_Prettier_** is a tool for automatic code formatting. Its main task is to enforce a consistent coding style in projects. Prettier supports various programming languages and file formats, and through integration with code editors or CI/CD scripts, it automatically adjusts code layout according to predefined rules, such as spacing, indentation, and quotation marks.

**_ESLint_** is a tool for static analysis of JavaScript and TypeScript code. Its purpose is to detect errors, code quality issues, and violations of best programming practices. It allows you to define rules and automate their enforcement.

**_Husky_** is a tool for managing Git hooks. It enables the automatic execution of scripts (e.g., tests, ESLint, or Prettier) before performing specific Git operations, such as commit or push. Husky ensures that code meets predefined standards before being committed to the repository.
